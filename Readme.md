<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

During your programming online lessons you will write hundreds of lines of code and dozens of snippets. For students following along with the code there's nothing more annoying than falling behind the explanation because of a small typo or a missed variable. With Code Paster you can simply copy your code examples and share it in real time with your classroom.

This project was developed by Lemoncode Frontend Master students:
